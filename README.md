## Project Overview
In this project, we analyze the sales data of Kevin Cookies Company from various countries worldwide. The goal is to understand the company's performance and identify areas of improvement in sales, revenue, and profitability.

The dataset includes information such as sales figures, units sold, product categories, profit margins, and the geographical distribution of sales. Using Excel, I created interactive charts and dashboards to visualize the sales data, making it easier to draw insights.

Data transformation and manipulation were carried out using **Pivot Tables** and **Microsoft Power Query** to clean and reshape the data into a more structured and insightful format for analysis.
